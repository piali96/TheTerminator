This is an edit distance word transformation game.

Language used: Python

Algorithm used: BFS

Words: You can use any list of words for the game, I have included a primitive list of words that I found on the internet. If you're using Ubuntu, uncomment the load dictionary function and you will be able to use the words available by default on the system (note: the makeGraph function will take slightly longer for the first time in this case due to the vast number of words)

I've called this TheTerminator since it runs on the terminal and is used to manipulate terms and get to the end term. It's a great pun. My professor thought it was quite witty.
