This is an edit distance word transformation game.

Language used: Python

Algorithm used: BFS

Words: You can use any list of words for the game, I have included a primitive list of words that I found on the internet. If you're using Ubuntu, uncomment the load dictionary function and you will be able to use the words available by default on the system (note: the makeGraph function will take slightly longer for the first time in this case due to the vast number of words)
